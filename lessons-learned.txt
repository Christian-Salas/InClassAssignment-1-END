Exercise 1 Introduced us to GitHub and we made our account. We also configured MobaXTerm for git config
Exercise 2 Introduced us to repositories, and how to move files to the staging area before committing.
Exercise 3 Introduced us to remote repositories and how to "push" to them.
  *Note the exercise instructions did not work due to GitHub removing HTTP password authentication.
  *As a workaround I created a token and found success pushing with the following commands
  *git remote add origin https://<GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN>@github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.git
  *git push origin master https://<GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN>@github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.git
  *It took a lot of googling but was very satisfying to see work.
Exercise 4 introduced branches and how our git work file is structured.
  *This part was the hardest to visualize but the YouTube video did a great job.
  *At the end I received the message when running git diff master..2ndfavorite

diff --git a/readme.md b/readme.md

  *This results helps visualize the effect of branching and how master when pulled is saved but the branches are not.
  *This lesson was very useful and helped clarify many GitHub questions.
  *Update the push portion and the lesson will be perfect!
